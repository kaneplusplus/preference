Description: The ct2stage package is used to design and analyize two-stage randomized
  trials with a continuous outcome measure. The package contains functions to compute
  the required sample size needed to detect a given preference, treatment, and 
  selection effect; alternatively, the package contains functions that can report the
  study power given a fixed sample size. Finally, analysis functions are provided to
  test each effect using either summary data (i.e. means, variances) or raw study data.
