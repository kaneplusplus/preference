Description: Design and analyze two-stage randomized trials with a continuous
    outcome measure. The package contains functions to compute the required 
    sample size needed to detect a given preference, treatment, and selection 
    effect; alternatively, the package contains functions that can report the 
    study power given a fixed sample size. Finally, analysis functions are 
    provided to test each effect using either summary data (i.e. means, 
    variances) or raw study data.
