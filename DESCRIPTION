Description: Design and analyze two-stage randomized trials with a continuous
    outcome measure. The package contains functions to compute the required sample
    size needed to detect a given preference, treatment, and selection effect;
    alternatively, the package contains functions that can report the study power
    given a fixed sample size. Finally, analysis functions are provided to test each
    effect using either summary data (i.e. means, variances) or raw study data.
