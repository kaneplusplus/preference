Description: Design and analyize two-stage 
  randomized trials with a continuous outcome measure. The package contains 
  functions to compute the required sample size needed to detect a given 
  preference, treatment, and selection effect; alternatively, the package 
  contains functions that can report the study power given a fixed sample size. 
  Finally, analysis functions are provided to test each effect using either 
  summary data (i.e. means, variances) or raw study data.
