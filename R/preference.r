#' @description The \pkg{preference} package is used for the design and 
#' analysis of two-stage randomized trials with a continuous outcome 
#' measure. In this study, patients are first randomized to either a 
#' random or choice arm. Patients 
#' initially randomized to the choice arm are allowed to select their preferred
#' treatment from the available treatment options; patients initially randomized
#' to the random arm undergo a second randomization procedure to one of the 
#' available treatment options. The design has also been extended to include
#' important stratification variables; the functions provided in this package
#' can accommodate both the unstratified and stratified designs.
#' 
#' In this study, there are three effects that may be of interest. The treatment
#' effect captures the difference in outcome between patients randomized to 
#' treatment A and treatment B (similar to a traditional RCT). The selection 
#' effect captures the difference in outcome between patients that prefer 
#' treatment A and patients that prefer treatment B, regardless of the 
#' treatment that is actually received. Finally, the preference effect compares
#' the outcomes of patients who receive their preferred treatment (either 
#' treatment A or treatment B) and patients who do not receive their preferred
#' treatment. 
#' 
#' To aid in the design of these two-stage randomized studies, sample size 
#' functions are provided to determine the necessary sample size to 
#' detect a particular selection, preference, and/or treatment effect. If the 
#' sample size is fixed prior to the start of the study, functions are provided
#' to calculate the study power to detect each effect. Finally, the 
#' \code{optimal_proportion} function can be used to determine the optimal 
#' proportion of patients randomized to the choice arm in the initial 
#' randomization. 
#' 
#' To analyze the data from the two-stage randomized trial, two analysis
#' functions are provided. The function \code{analyze_raw_data} computes the 
#' test statistic and p-value for each effect given provided raw study data. 
#' The function \code{analyze_summary_data} uses provided summary data (mean, 
#' variance, and sample size) of each study group to compute the test statistic
#' and p-value of each effect.

#' @description 
#' The ``Improving Management of Abnormal Pap Smears'' study used a 
#' two-stage randomized preference trial design to evaluate psychosocial
#' outcomes in women found to have atypical cells in a Pap Smear.
#' Two systems for managing the atypical cells were tested (repeated Pap smears 
#' or HCV triage) and a doubly randomized design was used to evaluate the role 
#' of patient preference. The data set provides mean, standard deviation and 
#' sample sizes of the SF36 outcome for each treatment in both the choice and 
#' random arms.
#'
#' Three data sets are provided with the preference package based on the
#' IMAP study. The first, \code{imap_summary} provides summary statistics
#' of the entire trial. The second \code{imap_summary_stratified}, summary
#' statistics of the study per strata. The third \code{imap} is a resampled
#' version of the individual level data including stratification. Each
#' of these data sets are compatible with the analysis functions 
#' \code{fit_preference_summary}, \code{fit_preference}, and 
#' \code{preference}, provided in this package. The examples sections
#' in the documentation illustrate their use.
